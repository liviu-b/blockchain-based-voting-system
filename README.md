## About the Project  

This project implements a blockchain-based voting system to provide a secure and transparent platform for conducting elections. By leveraging blockchain technology, the system ensures that votes are immutable and verifiable, eliminating the risk of tampering or fraud.  

## Features  

- Decentralized and secure voting process.  
- Transparent and immutable vote storage.  
- User-friendly interface for voters and administrators.  
- Built with modern web technologies.  

## Technologies Used  

- **TypeScript** (92.7%)  
- **JavaScript** (5.2%)  
- **HTML** (1.8%)  
- **CSS** (0.3%)  
- Blockchain technology (e.g., Ethereum or similar platforms).  
- Frontend framework (e.g., React or similar).  
- Backend integration with smart contracts.  

## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:  

- Node.js (v16 or higher)  
- npm or yarn  
- A blockchain development environment (e.g., Ganache, Hardhat, or Truffle)
